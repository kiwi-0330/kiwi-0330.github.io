            <p.center>This is a personal site that is a bit of a blog, somewhat a journal, and really any type of writing I want to do.</p>
            <br>
            <p.center>I also want to learn some website skills.  Work more with HTML and CSS, maybe dable in some other stuff like javascript. Who knows what'll happen</p>
