        <h1 class="title">My Opinions on Everything</h1>
        <p>I pulled these prompts from a book of the same name that I kinda fell in love with.  It is a great way to explore my feelings on different topics and to practivce putting thoughts into words.  It is probably the best structured journal experience I have come across yet.</p>
        
        <span class="prompt">
            <h2>Why is it that some people never find a partner to love?</h2>
            <p class="prompt">I don't think everyone needs a partner.</p>
            <p class="prompt">Getting married and finding a partner to spend your life with carries a lot of signifigance in most cultures of the world... well, at least most of the cultures I know about.  To some extent I agree with them.  I think friendship and companionship are important but romantic love is not a necessary factor in that.</p>
            <p class="prompt">People need other people, there is no way around that.  You are not going to have a happy, successful life without others in it.  I would go as far to say that you won't even have a content life with out having at least one long term friend.  That is the destinction I want to make though: <em>friend</em>.</p>
            <p class="prompt">We all crave connection and companionship but there is more that one way to get that.  A lot of people find someone that they work well with and build a relationship and a family around that.  Some people, however, never find that person that they want to put the work in with.  Or they meet them at the wrong time.</p>
            <p class="prompt">A lot of things need to go right for two people to find lasting love.  They both need to be open to love for one thing.  They also both need to be willing to put in the work to build a relationship when they meet. They need multiple differnt levels of attaction to bring them together and they have to be willing to compromise and be accepting on things they don't like as much.  It takes a lot of work and it doesn't always work.</p>
            <p class="prompt">I think I am starting to ramble here and I think I want to come back to this but I will end for now with a summary.</p>
            <p class="prompt">Not everyone finds a partner becasue not everyone is looking for one. Not every one that is looking (read as "interested") is willing to put in the work for a partnership to succeed either.  Life is messy and a lot has to go right for two people to have happy successful lives together. That being said, I do think eveyone finds <em>something</em> to love, even if it isn't <em>someone</em>.</p>

        <span class="prompt">
            <h2>Do you think that people would stop killing animals if we learned they have a higher level of intelligence than we realized?</h2>
            <p class="prompt">Ultimately, yes.  It wouldn't be an overnight change however.  Some people can flip that switch and would make immediate changes.  Stop eating animals, treat them better.</p>  

            <p class="prompt">Others are more stuck in their ways and aren't good at changing based on new information.  What they learned first is how it is. Animals are uninteligent and it is fine to keep living my life the same way.  They might legitimately believe they are right or be refusing to acknowledge that they aren't because the new information is too much to deal with.</p>

            <p class="prompt">Not only do they have to accept that animals are intelligent beings, they have to reconcile with their past behavior.  They have eaten meat all their lives, maybe gone hunting;  Admitting that animals are intelligent would mean admitting they have been killing intelligent beings their whole lives.  For some, it is a way of life even and would mean radical change to how they live and survive.</p>

            <p class="prompt">As time goes on, though.  More and more people will accept that we were wrong.  Everybody growing up after the discovery will just take it as fact (for the most part).  They won't know of a world that was any other way.  At the same time, the holdouts will keep getting older and over time there will be a societal shift as a new generation takes over.  Maybe it takes one generation for things to change, maybe 2, or 3; we can never know.  I think it will have a larger long term change on how we interact with animals however.</p>
