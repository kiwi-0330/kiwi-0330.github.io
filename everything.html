        <h1 class="title">My Opinions on Everything</h1>
        <p>I pulled these prompts from a book of the same name that I kinda fell in love with.  It is a great way to explore my feelings on different topics and to practivce putting thoughts into words.  It is probably the best structured journal experience I have come across yet.</p>
        
        <h2 class="prompt">Why is it that some people never find a partner to love?</h2>
        <p class="prompt">I don't think everyone needs a partner.</p>
        <p class="prompt">Getting married and finding a partner to spend your life with carries a lot of signifigance in most cultures of the world... well, at least most of the cultures I know about.  To some extent I agree with them.  I think friendship and companionship are important but romantic love is not a necessary factor in that.</p>
        <p class="prompt">People need other people, there is no way around that.  You are not going to have a happy, successful life without others in it.  I would go as far to say that you won't even have a content life with out having at least one long term friend.  That is the destinction I want to make though: <em>friend</em>.</p>
        <p class="prompt">We all crave connection and companionship but there is more that one way to get that.  A lot of people find someone that they work well with and build a relationship and a family around that.  Some people, however, never find that person that they want to put the work in with.  Or they meet them at the wrong time.</p>
        <p class="prompt">A lot of things need to go right for two people to find lasting love.  They both need to be open to love for one thing.  They also both need to be willing to put in the work to build a relationship when they meet. They need multiple differnt levels of attaction to bring them together and they have to be willing to compromise and be accepting on things they don't like as much.  It takes a lot of work and it doesn't always work.</p>
        <p class="prompt">I think I am starting to ramble here and I think I want to come back to this but I will end for now with a summary.</p>
        <p class="prompt">Not everyone finds a partner becasue not everyone is looking for one. Not every one that is looking (read as "interested") is willing to put in the work for a partnership to succeed either.  Life is messy and a lot has to go right for two people to have happy successful lives together. That being said, I do think eveyone finds <em>something</em> to love, even if it isn't <em>someone</em>.</p>
